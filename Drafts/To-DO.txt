1. why this algorithm is used
2. quality of experiment done
3. explaination of the experiment done - general and mathematical
4. code commenting(remaining)
5. Lit review



take mean of the data and compare it


DONE:
literature review


• What are the models behind the two classification algorithms you chose and
implemented?
• What is your experiment setup for training these classifiers, and how are you going
to measure the performance of your classification algorithms?
• Compare the performance of these two algorithms (You can use the metrics you
learned in the course, or any other measurements appropriate).
• Can you obtain better performance by using only a subset of the features?
